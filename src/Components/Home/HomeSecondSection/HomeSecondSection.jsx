                                The notion of Metaverse arguably refers to the digitalization and dematerialization of a
                                great many facets of our surroundings and activities. It is uncontested that the
                                Metaverse will not only affect but also become part of everyoneâ€™s future.

                                As our society values freedom above all else, it is necessary to keep the provisioning
                                of Metaverse and its inclusion in the control of the people, as opposed to leaving it
                                for a selected few Big Tech. To this end, decentralization is the only provably feasible
                                approach. The Decentralised Metaverse, which is built atop the Decentralized Ledger
                                Technology (DLT), is the one and only Metaverse that will prevail.

                                Digital identities will play the central role in the Metaverse. They equip people from
                                every walk of life with a capability of expressing and presenting themselves in new
                                ways, allowing for new forms of interaction. As the metaverse itself needs
                                decentralizing, the issuance, management and utilization of these digital identities
                                also necessitate decentralization.

                                We take a dual approach to tackle the aforementioned sine qua non. On the one hand, the
                                digital identity can be represented by a Soul Bound Token (SBT) that tenants a
                                decentralized ledger (aka blockchain). SBTs are issued and bound to unique blockchain
                                accounts or wallets associated with specific individuals. On the other hand, Urust
                                Global follows and contributes to the open standard set forth by W3C Decentralized
                                Identifier Working Group and the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF).

                                The traditional financial systems include too many hindrances, whereas the native crypto
                                solutions typically lack necessary KYC and AML measurements. Urust Global strikes a
                                delicate balance between DTL-empowered cross-border payment and the rigorousness and
                                accountability of any large-scale transaction system.
